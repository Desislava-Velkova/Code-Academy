    1.Create a directory in your home directory called projects. In the projects
directory, create nine empty fi les that are named house1, house2, house3,
and so on to house9. Assuming there are lots of other fi les in that directory,
come up with a single argument to ls that would list just those nine files.

    mkdir projects
    
    cd projects
    
    touch house{1..9}

    ls *house*
